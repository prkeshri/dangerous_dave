# A very dangerous Dave
This is an unusual blogpost about a bug (vulnerability?) that has been bothering me for years.  
When I was a kid I used to play tons of old DOS games. [Commander Keen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen)? With pleasure! [SkyRoads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyRoads_(video_game))? I remember most stages by heart. [AlleyCat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Cat_(video_game))? Oh yes!  
Well, one of the most remembered games from that era is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Dave](Dangerous Dave).  
You see, Dangerous Dave was a platformer - it had 10 levels, with each one your goal is to get to a trophy and pass through a door.  
Some of these levels had `Warp Zones` which are "secret levels", and you get to them by going out-of-bounds.  
Being an inquisitive young boy, I tried to find all warp zones, and I accidently found an unexpected one in level 6, which caused an unexpected behavior.  
Here is a video recording of that:
